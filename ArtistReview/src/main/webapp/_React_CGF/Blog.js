            <p>Database Experience: Projects I worked on that require storage of data and working with other people creating and updating the sql structure and information stored there. <br/>
            I used to create sql structures through C++ and Java, I had MySQL workbench but I was more of a terminal and incode person for SQL database access and I created the database structure from the code.
            </p>

            <p>Web Development Experience: I used to make sites with only html and css, but got bored until then switched to javascript and php, but I still use html for game development</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Database Design:
                For now I'm thinking of having a user review system of artist on the site and thier works.
                I'll call it a record table and it includes the following fields:
                <br/>
                record_id(PK), artist_name, artist_image(URL), artist_id(Optional Non_Char), artist_description, artist_category, catalog_no(Optional Non_Char), catalog_description, pt_user_id
            </p>
