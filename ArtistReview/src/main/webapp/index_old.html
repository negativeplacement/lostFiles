            Database Experience: I used to create sql structures through C++ and Java, I had MySQL workbench but I was more of a terminal and incode person for SQL database access and I created the database structure from the code.

            I didnt really find anything about this homework particularlly hard as I am familair with databases and this helps as a reminder as I haven't wrote some code for database managament for some time.

                For now I'm thinking of having a recent user history of the user exploration
                I'll call it a record table
                <ul>
                    <li>record_id</li>
                    <li>artist_name</li>
                    <li>artist_image</li>
                    <li>artist_id</li>
                    <li>artist_description</li>
                    <li>artist_category</li>
                    <li>catalog_no</li>
                    <li>catalog_description</li>
                    <li>pt_user_id</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Database Experience: Projects I worked on that require storage of data and working with other people creating and updating the sql structure and information stored there.</p>
            <p>Web Development Experience: I used to make sites with only html and css, but got bored until then switched to javascript and php, but I still use html for game development</p>
            <p>Difficulties: It was things I'm familiar with. Only difficulties is issues I'm dealing outside of school that affect my ability to complete tasks. I did find media quary valuable </p>
